# Crypto Portfolio Tracker

## Coinbase ![Coinbase Logo](src/images/readme/coinbase-logo.png) </br>

Coinbase is an app that lets you buy and sell all sorts of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and about 50 others. You can also use Coinbase to convert one cryptocurrency to another, or to send and receive cryptocurrency to and from other people.</br>

Coinbase also offers a great developer portal for software engineers to develop apps based off of their platform.
For this project I have implemented the price endpoint offered by Coinbase to find out specific cryptocurrency
prices. </br>

## Purpose of the Project </br>

My purpose of this project is to showcase the backend skills that I have acquired through NodeJS and database skills with MongoDB. I also wanted to further my skills and programming abilities. The backend allows to find out the prices of any Cryptocurrency. It is connected to a cloud based MongoDB database.

### Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- Creating and adding User's crypto purchases to their portfolio.
- Removing User's crypto from their portfolio.
- Searching for crypto prices.

### **Things I learned throughout**

This wasn't my first backend project with NodeJS, and because of that I was able to come into it with a firm understanding of the fundamentals. Throughout this project I tried to focus on furthering my knowledge of Node. I also made a conscious effort to follow best practices. Mainly with naming functions and variables.</br>
The biggest thing that I took away from this project was the relationship of the server and the database. I have worked with MongoDB, but this was the first time implementing it into my own project.</br>
